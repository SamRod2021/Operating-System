One operating system function is virtual memory. Virtual memory is a kind of storage that functions as additional RAM. A computer can access more memory than the amount that is physically implemented onto it. It is a paty of a hard disk that is designed to emulate RAM. It acts as a secondary memory which is addressed as though it was part of the main memory function. 
Another operating system is user interface. User interface is a key componet of operating systems. It assists in achieving the commands thats the user gives. These commands or inputs are then received and the output is then processed from the system. It is a set of programs that are essential to managing the computers hardware resourses. (Meaningful note: this is just my basic level understanding and research and isn't everything about these systems. I encourage those who find this interesting to follow up with research of your own.)
